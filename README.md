# Reactodo: A Modern To-Do List App - and my first React.js project. #

Reactodo is a minimalist and efficient to-do list application designed to help you manage your tasks effortlessly. 

# Features: #

1. Task Input:
Users can easily input their tasks by typing in the task, and either pressing the Enter key or clicking the “Add Task” button.
The input field provides a seamless experience for adding new tasks.

2. Task List:
All added tasks are displayed in a clean and organized list format.

3. Task Completion:
Users can mark a task as completed by clicking on it. And yes, you can un-complete the task too!
Completed tasks are visually crossed out, making it easy to track progress.

4. Task Removal:
To remove a task, users have two options:
Press the “Del” key on their keyboard (for quick removal).
Click the “Clear Tasks” button located below the task list (for bulk removal).

5. Persistent State:
Reactodo utilizes local storage to persist the task list even after the user refreshes the browser window.
This ensures that your tasks remain intact across sessions.

6. Neon-Colored Theme:
Reactodo boasts a modern neon-colored theme that adds a touch of vibrancy to your task management experience.
The combination of bright hues and clean design makes it visually appealing.

7. Frontend Stack:
HTML provides the basic structure of the app, CSS styles the app, including the neon color scheme, React.js handles dynamic rendering, state management, and user interactions.

8. Local Storage:
Reactodo uses the browser’s local storage to store task data persistently.
Even if you close the browser or refresh the page, your tasks will be waiting for you when you return.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
